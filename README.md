# Dreamflow vs Flutter – Accompanying Files

This repository contains the supporting assets used in the **Dreamflow vs Flutter** YouTube video 📹

The video explores two different approaches to generating a working Flutter application using AI:

1️⃣ **Dreamflow** – Building directly from a prompt inside the platform  
2️⃣ **Local Agent Approach** – Using Windsurf (or another AI-assisted IDE) to build and refine Flutter code locally
